      As a genuine introvert, I am deeply passionate about design in all its forms - from drawing to typography and beyond.

I am also a tech enthusiast and love to explore new gadgets and software, which is why I enjoy watching sci-fi movies.

Professionally, I work as a web developer and have gained expertise in using PHP Symfony framework and Laravel, which I have been using lately.
